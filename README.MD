 # SVG Logo Generator

## Description
This Node.js command-line application generates a simple logo based on user input and saves it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

## User Story
As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects quickly and easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given a command-line application that accepts user input.
- When I am prompted for text, then I can enter up to three characters.
- When I am prompted for the text color, then I can enter a color.
- When I am prompted for a shape, then I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
- When I am prompted for the shape's color, then I can enter a color.
- When I have entered input for all the prompts, then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`.
- The output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.
- When I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser, then I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered.
